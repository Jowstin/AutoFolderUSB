# AutoFolderUSB
This was created by Jowstin Fox.

This is just a little thing I made after my python class. This just makes folders for your USB, that I usually make when I get a new USB. It isn't really useful but hey I made it.

Run the python program in the USB that you want to creates the folders in.
This works in both Linux and Windows.

*IMPORTANT* *Put this file in the same location as you want to put the folders* *IMPORTANT*
